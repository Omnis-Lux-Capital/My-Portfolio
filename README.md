Welcome to the **Omnis Lux Capital** development portfolio — a structured directory for organizing all projects under one clean, modular system.

This is **not** a showcase.  
This is the **root vault** — where every tool, game, and system begins its journey.

---

## 📁 Folder Overview

- `Projects/` → Every project lives here, self-contained with source code + README
- `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, and repo-wide configs remain in root
- Each subfolder is built for clarity, reusability, and performance

---

## 🛠️ Structure Philosophy

- Each project is **independent and isolated**
- Minimal global clutter
- Built with **execution > aesthetics** in mind

---

## 📌 Versioning Strategy

All releases follow `semantic versioning` (e.g., `v1.0.0`)  
Projects are committed only when **stable, tested, and clean**
