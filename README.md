This directory contains **all active and completed projects**.

Each folder inside represents one project, structured for:

- Total independence  
- Clear separation of code + assets  
- Easy zipping, deployment, or cloning

---

## 🔍 Inside Each Project Folder

Every project contains:

- Its own `README.md`
- Its own `main.*` or `index.*` entry point
- An `assets/` directory (if needed)
- All files required to run independently

---

## 🚫 What You Won’t Find Here

- No monolith builds  
- No shared resources between projects  
- No global dependencies across folders

---

> This folder is the **sandbox**. Every tool, calculator, game, or prototype lives here — ready for refinement or release

Welcome to the **Omnis Lux Capital** development portfolio — a structured directory for organizing all projects under one clean, modular system.

This is **not** a showcase.  
This is the **root vault** — where every tool, game, and system begins its journey.

---

## 📁 Folder Overview

- `Projects/` → Every project lives here, self-contained with source code + README
- `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, and repo-wide configs remain in root
- Each subfolder is built for clarity, reusability, and performance

---

## 🛠️ Structure Philosophy

- Each project is **independent and isolated**
- Minimal global clutter
- Built with **execution > aesthetics** in mind

---

## 📌 Versioning Strategy

All releases follow `semantic versioning` (e.g., `v1.0.0`)  
Projects are committed only when **stable, tested, and clean**
