Welcome to my **personal developer portfolio** — a curated vault of projects that blend precision, creativity, and code.  
Each build is crafted with intention, powered by clean architecture and sharp execution.

📁 Structure

portfolio/

└── Projects/

├── GameBoyCalculator/

└── [More Projects Soon]

- Each project lives in its **own folder**
- Comes with its own `README.md`, source code, and assets
- No clutter. Just clean, modular builds.

📦 Releases

All project releases are versioned and **independent**.  
Only the specific project contents are zipped — not the entire portfolio.

**Release Format:**

GameBoyCalculator-v1.0.0.zip ✅

> _Disregard GitHub's default "Source Code (zip)" unless you want the entire repo._

🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** (core builds)
- Python / API integration (future full-stack builds)
- Retro designs, clean UI/UX, and modern functionality

🧠 Mindset

- Built for **execution, not perfection**
- Always **learning**, refining, upgrading
- Focused on **practical impact**, not flashy filler

---

📌 Versioning Philosophy

- Follows semantic versioning: `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`, etc.
- Projects are released when **fully functional & clean**
- Roadmaps and upgrades tracked per project

This repo is open-source for **inspiration, collaboration, and creativity.**  
Each project may include its own specific license.
