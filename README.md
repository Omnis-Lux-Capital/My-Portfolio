# My-Portfolio
My personal developer portfolio featuring creative and technical web projects — starting with a custom-built Game Boy Calculator.

# Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my personal developer portfolio — a growing collection of creative, technical, and just plain cool projects that show off what I’m learning and building. This repo is home to all of my frontend and backend projects, each stored in their own folders inside the `Projects/` directory.

### Featured Project: **Game Boy Calculator**

My very first project — a fully functional calculator that looks like a classic Game Boy Color.

- Built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**
- Calculator buttons are invisible overlays, mapped with pixel-perfect precision
- Output is displayed directly on the Game Boy LCD screen for a seamless illusion
- No keyboard support (yet) — mouse clicks only
- D-Pad, A, and B buttons are non-functional by design
