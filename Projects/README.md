This directory contains **all active and completed projects**.

Each folder inside represents one project, structured for:

- Total independence  
- Clear separation of code + assets  
- Easy zipping, deployment, or cloning

---

## 🔍 Inside Each Project Folder

Every project contains:

- Its own `README.md`
- Its own `main.*` or `index.*` entry point
- An `assets/` directory (if needed)
- All files required to run independently

---

## 🚫 What You Won’t Find Here

- No monolith builds  
- No shared resources between projects  
- No global dependencies across folders

---

> This folder is the **sandbox**. Every tool, calculator, game, or prototype lives here — ready for refinement or release.
